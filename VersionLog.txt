### Version 1.0
- Estimates individual HRF parameters, tau & delta
- Fits 1D Gaussian pRF model with parameters, mu & sigma; includes a compressive spatal summation exponential parameter, exp  

### Version 1.1
- Added cost option to parameter estimation
- Fixed convolution of stimulus that is not time locked to scan's TRs. Note currently only works so long as stimulus presentation interval is constant and not jittered
- Added plotting functions to plot parameter histograms and pRF model predicted voxel time courses vs. actual voxel time courses
- Added demonstration scripts and data (see Demonstration section)
- Added BrainVoyager QX compatible functions and demo files for visualization for demonstration data
- Fixed bugs for single scan inputs
- Optimizing script for additional efficient and interfacing
- Added more misc. functions  

### Version 2.0
- Added m-D pRF modeling! (finally)
- Added options to fit pRF model and HRF (in iterations) in one go
- Changed mentions of 'HDR' to 'HRF' 
- Iterative HRF takes subset of voxels past settable threshold after initial pRF parameter(s) fitting then fits tau and delta parameters of HRF. HRF parameters are then held constant to be pRF fitted. This cycle repeats ending on a HRF fit for however many HRF fitting iterations specified.  
- Added createModel.m, GLMinVOI.m, callFitModel.m, callFitHRF.m
- Edited bug in safeSave.m
- Modified createConvStim, createScans, createPaths, createStimImg, estpRF, predictpRF for m-D pRF modeling
- Added voi2mat.m; saves linear indices of .voi coordinates within a .vtc as a .mat
- Added nestedF.m; computes a nested F test on each voxel where Model 1 must be nested within Model 2.
- Added more misc. functions

### Version 2.1
- Added stimulus image capabilities, can now supply a "movie" of stimulus in time
- Added HRF options, can now provide a previously estimated HRF, non-parameterized, to be used in pRF convolution instead of parameterized version
- Added general pRF / fMRI walk-through in 'Tutorial' folder
- Reorganized pRF package structure
- Edited misc. functions for use outside of pRF package (i.e., removing some forced structure arguments)

### Version 2.2
- ~~~~!!!!!~~~~ WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP ~~~~!!!!!~~~~
- Edited HRF options, can now provide other parameterized HRF function other than the BoyntonHRF
